        <h3>Comprehensive Curriculum</h3>
        <p>Our curriculum is carefully structured to take students from the fundamentals through to real-world application. Each module focuses on practical skills — from programming basics and algorithms to web development, databases and deployment. Students complete hands-on projects every week, build a portfolio, and receive regular feedback so they graduate with both the knowledge and the artifacts employers care about.</p>
